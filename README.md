# Visu's Color Generator
Just a simple color generator. My first JS project from scratch. JS heavy, and CSS heavy.

You can visit https://visu.studio/color for the demo.

This is my first JS project from scratch.  was done under 10 hours.

You can edit and modify the code, but you cannot share it as your own. You can keep a fork on GitHub, but you need to ask me first. You can't host it on your own website.
I don't know if anyone would bother, but just simply ask me first.

Huge thanks to Brad Traversy for his YouTube videos on HTML, CSS and JS and his Udemy courses, which is how I learned in the first place.

These links probably make up about 30% of the code. The rest are all my functions. Also I had to edit these and make external functions.
