# Visu's Color Generator
Just a simple color generator. My first JS project from scratch. Also CSS heavy.

You can visit https://visu.studio/color for the demo.

This is my first JS project from scratch.
was done under 10 hours.

You can edit and modify the code, but you cannot share it as your own. You can keep a fork on GitHub, but you need to ask me first. You can't host it on your own website.
I don't know if anyone would bother, but just simply ask me first.
